# Time complexity => # The process of analysing time complexity of algorithm or programm as it vaeries on input

# rate of growth => # rate of time increases as the function of input is known as rate of growth

# commonly rate of growth:

# 1 => constant
# logn => logarthamic
# n => Linear
# nlogn => Linear logarthamic
# (n)2 => Quadratic
# (n)3 => Cubic
# (2)n => exponential
# n! => factorial

# Types of Analysis => 

# worst-case => Big O notation(O)
# Best-case => Omega notation(omega)
# Average-case => Theta notation(Theta)

# Asymptotic Notations => It is used to determine the upper-bound and lower-bond

# Types of Notations:

# => Big O notation(O)
# => Omega notation(omega)
# => Theta notation(Theta)

# Time complexity based on loops

#single for loop:

# for i in range(0,5): |=>O(n)
#     print(i)         |

# nested for loop:

# for i in range(0,5):   |
#   for i in range(0,j): |=>O((n)2)
#     print(i)         | |
        |

#consecutive for loop:

# for i in range(0,5):   |
#     print(i)           |
#                        |=>O((n)2)
# for i in range(0,5):   |
#   for i in range(0,j): |
#     print(i)         | |

# DataStructure

#  A DataStructure is used to organize,manage and store data in specific format.

# Types of DataStructure
# 1)primitive
# 2)non-primitive

# 1)primitive=>

# a)integer
# b)Character
# c)Float
# d)String
# e)Double

# 2)Non-primitive=>

# a)Linear
# b)Non-Linear

# a)Linear=>

# 1)Array
# 2)Queue
# 3)Stack
# 4)Linkedlist

# b)Non-Linear=>

# 1)Tree
